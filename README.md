Submitted by: Oshan Maharjan

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## Summary

Random is an android app that generates random dog picture, number of click and picture file name/
If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üê∂üêïüê©

## Application Features


The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [x] Build a UI to allow users to add that query


## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random
